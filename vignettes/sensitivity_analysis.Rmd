Parameter calibration can have a big impact on our modeling effort and use
big computational resources. Hence, it is worth our time to explore which parameters
should actually be calibrated (the ones that impact the simulations greatly) 
and to examine if the calibration routines behave as expected. 
This vignette explains how to perform a simple
parameter sensitivity analysis for the P-model and how to interpret the outputs 
of the calibration using the `BayesianTools` package.

## Morris sensitivity analysis

The Morris method for global sensitivity analysis allows to explore which parameters have the
biggest influence on the model fit. In this example, we will quantify how different
values of the calibratable model parameters lead to more variability
in the match between GPP predicted by the P-model and GPP observations. It would
be wise to repeat this exercise for various targets because they may be simulated
by equations in the P-model that involve different model parameters.

If the P-model
has very low sensitivity to a certain parameter, calibrating it will
not improve the model substantially. But if it's very sensitive to another parameter,
calibrating this second parameter could improve the P-model fit greatly. We should
spend our computational resources on calibrating the parameters to which the
model is most sensitive.

First of all, let's define a function which measures the agreement between
GPP predictions from the P-model and GPP observations, for a set of values of
the calibratable parameters. It computes the normal log-likelihood of 
the GPP predictions, given the observed GPP and its uncertainty.
We want to see how sensitive this function is to changes in the parameter values.

```{r}
# Define log-likelihood function
ll_pmodel <- function(
    par_v                 # a vector of all calibratable parameters including errors
){
  rsofun::cost_likelihood_pmodel(        # reuse likelihood cost function
    par_v,
    obs = rsofun::p_model_validation,
    drivers = rsofun::p_model_drivers,
    targets = "gpp"
  )
}

# Compute log-likelihood for a given set of parameters
ll_pmodel( par_v = c(
  kphio              = 0.09423773, # setup ORG in Stocker et al. 2020 GMD
  kphio_par_a        = 0.0,        # set to zero to disable temperature-dependence of kphio, setup ORG in Stocker et al. 2020 GMD
  kphio_par_b        = 1.0,
  soilm_thetastar    = 0.6 * 240,  # to recover old setup with soil moisture stress
  soilm_betao        = 0.0,
  beta_unitcostratio = 146.0,
  rd_to_vcmax        = 0.014,      # value from Atkin et al. 2015 for C3 herbaceous
  tau_acclim         = 30.0,
  kc_jmax            = 0.41,
  error_gpp          = 0.9         # value from previous simulations
))
```

Some parameters are constrained by their physical interpretation (e.g. `kphio > 0`)
and it's also necessary to provide a bounded parameter space for Morris'
method to sample the parameter space. We define the parameter space by their 
lower and upper bounds.
```{r}
# best parameter values (from previous literature)
par_cal_best <- c(
    kphio              = 0.09423773,
    kphio_par_a        = 0.1,
    kphio_par_b        = 25,
    soilm_thetastar    = 0.6*240,
    soilm_betao        = 0.2,
    beta_unitcostratio = 146.0,
    rd_to_vcmax        = 0.014,
    tau_acclim         = 30.0,
    kc_jmax            = 0.41,
    error_gpp          = 1
  )

# lower bound
par_cal_min <- c(
    kphio              = 0.0,
    kphio_par_a        = -0.2,
    kphio_par_b        = 10,
    soilm_thetastar    = 0,
    soilm_betao        = 0,
    beta_unitcostratio = 50.0,
    rd_to_vcmax        = 0.01,
    tau_acclim         = 7.0,
    kc_jmax            = 0.2,
    error_gpp          = 0.01
  )

# upper bound
par_cal_max <- c(
    kphio              = 5.0,
    kphio_par_a        = 0.5,
    kphio_par_b        = 40.0,
    soilm_thetastar    = 3000,
    soilm_betao        = 1,
    beta_unitcostratio = 200.0,
    rd_to_vcmax        = 0.1,
    tau_acclim         = 60.0,
    kc_jmax            = 0.8,
    error_gpp          = 4
  )
```

We use the `morris()` function from the `{sensitivity}` package to perform
the sensitivity analysis. As a target function, we will use the posterior
density (log-likelihood) of the parameters given the GPP data which we obtain
via the function `BayesianTools::createBayesianSetup()`. Note that, because of using
a uniform prior, the posterior distribution is proportional to the GPP 
log-likelihood (defined previously) 
wherever the parameter values are feasible and zero outside of the parameter ranges.
```{r eval = FALSE}
morris_setup <- BayesianTools::createBayesianSetup(
  likelihood = ll_pmodel,
  prior = BayesianTools::createUniformPrior(par_cal_min, par_cal_max, par_cal_best),
  names = names(par_cal_best)
)
```

In the following chunk, we run the Morris sensitivity analysis, using a grid with
`r=500` values for each parameter and a one-at-a-time design. Running the
sensitivity analysis may take a few minutes, even for this small example dataset,
and is still computationally cheaper than running the parameter calibration.
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(432)
morrisOut <- sensitivity::morris(
  model = morris_setup$posterior$density,
  factors = names(par_cal_best), 
  r = 1000, 
  design = list(type = "oat", levels = 20, grid.jump = 3), 
  binf = par_cal_min, 
  bsup = par_cal_max, 
  scale = TRUE)
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Save Morris sensitivity output because it takes very long to compute
save(morrisOut, file = "files/morrisOut.rda")
```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# Load Morris sensitivity output
load("files/morrisOut.rda")
```

The analysis evaluates the variability of the target function, i.e. the 
log-likelihood, for several points across the parameter space. 
Statistics $\mu *$ and $\sigma$ measure the average of the absolute
differences between these log-likelihood values and their standard deviation,
respectively. The higher the value of these statistics for a given parameter, 
the more influential the parameter is.  
```{r eval = TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
# summarise the morris output
morrisOut.df <- data.frame(
  parameter = names(par_cal_best),
  mu.star = apply(abs(morrisOut$ee), 2, mean, na.rm = T),
  sigma = apply(morrisOut$ee, 2, sd, na.rm = T)
) %>%
  arrange( mu.star )

morrisOut.df |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer( -parameter, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") |>
  ggplot(aes(
    reorder(parameter, value),
    value, 
    fill = variable),
    color = NA) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(), stat = 'identity') +
  scale_fill_brewer("", labels = c('mu.star' = expression(mu * "*"),
                                   'sigma' = expression(sigma))) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_text(size = 6),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    legend.position = c(0.05, 0.95), legend.justification = c(0.05, 0.95)
  )

```

## Interpretation of Bayesian calibration routine

It is always important to check the convergence of the MCMC algorithm used for the Bayesian calibration. Here we show some plots and statistics that may help you assess whether the parameter calibration has converged.

According to the previous sensitivity analysis, calibrating the error parameter for GPP and the Jmax cost ratio parameters will have the most impact on the model fit. Let's run the calibration:
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(2023)

# Define calibration settings
settings_calib <- list(
  method = "BayesianTools",
  metric = rsofun::cost_likelihood_pmodel,
  control = list(
    sampler = "DEzs",
    settings = list(
      burnin = 300,
      iterations = 3000,
      startValue = 3       # number of chains to be sampled
    )),
  par = list(
    kphio = list(lower = 0, upper = 0.2, init = 0.05),
    kphio_par_a = list(lower = -0.2, upper = 0.5, init = 0.1),
    kphio_par_b = list(lower = 10, upper = 40, init =25),
    kc_jmax = list(lower = 0.2, upper = 0.8, init = 0.41),
    err_gpp = list(lower = 0.1, upper = 3, init = 0.8)
  )
)

# calibrate parameters kphio and err_gpp 
par_calib <- calib_sofun(
  drivers = p_model_drivers,
  obs = p_model_validation,
  settings = settings_calib,
  par_fixed = list(
    soilm_thetastar    = 0.6*240,
    soilm_betao        = 0.2,
    beta_unitcostratio = 146.0,
    rd_to_vcmax        = 0.014,
    tau_acclim         = 30.0),
  targets = "gpp"
)
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(2023)

# Define calibration settings
settings_calib <- list(
  method = "BayesianTools",
  metric = rsofun::cost_likelihood_pmodel,
  control = list(
    sampler = "DEzs",
    settings = list(
      burnin = 300,
      iterations = 3000,
      startValue = 3       # number of chains to be sampled
    )),
  par = list(
    kc_jmax = list(lower = 0.2, upper = 0.8, init = 0.41),
    err_gpp = list(lower = 0.1, upper = 3, init = 0.8)
  )
)

# calibrate parameters kc_jmax and err_gpp 
par_calib <- calib_sofun(
  drivers = p_model_drivers,
  obs = p_model_validation,
  settings = settings_calib,
  par_fixed = list(
    kphio = 0.05,
    kphio_par_a = -0.0001,
    kphio_par_b = 33,
    soilm_thetastar    = 0.6*240,
    soilm_betao        = 0.2,
    beta_unitcostratio = 146.0,
    rd_to_vcmax        = 0.014,
    tau_acclim         = 30.0),
  targets = "gpp"
)
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Save calibration output because it takes very long to compute
save(par_calib, file = "files/par_calib.rda")
```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# Load calibration output
load("files/par_calib.rda")
```

`BayesianTools` makes it easy to produce the trace plot of the MCMC chains and the posterior density plot for the parameters. Trace plots show the time series of the sampled chains, which should reach a stationary state. One can also choose a burnin visually, to discard the early iterations and keep only the samples from the stationary distribution to which they converge. The samples after the burnin period are then used for inference.
```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
# par(mar = c(2,2,2,2))
plot(par_calib$mod)
```

The posterior density plots are quite lumpy. In this case it's advisable to run the MCMC algorithm for more iterations, in order to get a better estimate of the parameters' posterior distributions. A good posterior should look more gaussian (although it can be skewed). A multimodal density indicates that the MCMC is still exploring the parameter space and hasn't converged yet. 

When convergence has been reached, the oscillation of the time series should look like white noise. The presence of a trend indicates that convergence hasn't been reached.

Trace plots can be deceiving and partial autocorrelation plots can throw some light. If autocorrelation is present, this can mean that the sampling is stuck in local maxima and the posterior parameter space may not be explored fully.
```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
# Define function for plotting chains separately
plot_acf_mcmc <- function(chains, par_names){
  # chains: from the BayesianTools output
  n_chains <- length(chains)
  par(mfrow = c(length(par_names), n_chains))
  for(i in 1:n_chains){
    for(par_name in par_names){
      chains[[i]][, par_name] |>
        pacf(main = paste0("Series of ", par_name, " , chain ", i))
    }
  }
}

plot_acf_mcmc(par_calib$mod$chain, c("err_gpp", "kc_jmax"))
```

Looking at the correlation between chains is also helpful because parameter correlation may slow down convergence, or the chains may oscillate in the multivariate posterior.
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
correlationPlot(par_calib$mod)
```

In addition to visualizations, it's helpful to compute some convergence diagnostics, like the Gelman-Brooks-Rubin (GBR) "potential scale factor" (psf). This diagnostic compares the variance within chains to that across chains and should progressively get closer to 1. It is common in the literature to accept a GBR between 1.05 and 1.1, indicating convergence. 

We use the `summary` function from the `BayesianTools` library, which shows the psf next to other parameter estimations. Finally, the parameter MAP estimates can be derived from the chains (that converged) after removing the burnin period.

```{r}
summary(par_calib$mod)
```
