\title{Calculate average trait prediction}
\usage{
get_avg_trait(output, traits)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{Object returned by \code{runread_pmodel_f()}, with GPP and leaf
trait P-model predictions.}

\item{traits}{A character vector indicating the variable names of the leaf traits
(from the P-model output), for example 'vcmax25'.}
}
\value{
A weighted average of the leaf trait, where days with higher predicted
GPP are upweighted. This is a proxy for getting the growing season average leaf
trait prediction. This average can be used for calibration against leaf trait
observations, which are usually measured during the growing season.
}
\description{
Average leaf trait prediction over growing season calculation
