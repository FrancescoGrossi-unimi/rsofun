\title{Cost function computing RMSE for calibration of different simulation setups}
\usage{
cost_rmse_pmodel(
  par,
  obs,
  drivers,
  setup,
  targets,
  par_fixed = NULL,
  target_weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{A vector of values for the parameters to be calibrated. These values 
can be updated by the optimizer within the calibration routine.}

\item{obs}{A nested data.frame of observations, with columns \code{'sitename'}
and \code{'data'} (see \code{p_model_validation} or \code{p_model_validation_vcmax25}
to check their structure).}

\item{drivers}{A nested data.frame of driver data. See \code{\link{p_model_drivers}}
for a description of the data structure.}

\item{setup}{A character string (\code{'BRC'} or \code{'FULL'}) indicating which
parameters are calibrated. For \code{setup = 'BRC'} only the quantum yield
efficiency \code{kphio} is calibrated; for \code{setup = 'FULL'} it also includes
the soil moisture stress parameter \code{soilm_par_a}
for calibration.}

\item{targets}{A character vector indicating the target variables for which the
optimization will be done and the RMSE computed. This string must be a column 
name of the \code{data} data.frame belonging to the validation nested data.frame 
(for example 'gpp').}

\item{par_fixed}{A vector of model parameter values to keep fixed during the
calibration. Only necessary if \code{setup = 'BRC'}.}

\item{target_weights}{A vector of weights to be used in the computation of
the RMSE if using several targets. By default (\code{target_weights = NULL})
the RMSE is computed separately for each target and then averaged. The provided
weights are used to compute a weighted average of RMSE across targets.}
}
\value{
The root mean squared error (RMSE) between observed values and P-model
predictions. The RMSE is computed for each target separately and then aggregated
(mean or weighted average).
}
\description{
The cost function performs a P-model run for the input drivers and parameter
values, and compares the output to observations of various targets by computing
the root mean squared error (RMSE).
}
\details{
To run the P-model, all model parameters must be given. The cost
function uses arguments \code{par} and \code{par_fixed} such that, in the
calibration routine, \code{par} can be updated by the optimizer and 
\code{par_fixed} kept unchanged throughout calibration.
  
If the validation data contains a "date" column (fluxes), the simulated target time series
is compared to the observed values on those same dates (e.g. for GPP). Otherwise, 
there should only be one observed value per site (leaf traits), and the outputs 
(averaged over the growing season, weighted by predicted GPP) will be 
compared to this single value representative of the site (e.g. Vcmax25). As an exception,
when the date of a trait measurement is available, it will be compared to the 
trait value predicted on that date.
